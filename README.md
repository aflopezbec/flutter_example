# Flutter Practical Implementations

This repository is designed to provide **practical examples of Flutter implementations**. Each example showcases a specific functionality, technique, or approach that can be useful when building Flutter applications.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to help developers:
- Understand key concepts in Flutter through **hands-on examples**.
- Learn step-by-step how to implement certain features.
- Get a reference for common Flutter patterns and practices.

## Pull Request Workflow

Each **Pull Request** in this repository represents a **step-by-step implementation** of a specific feature or concept. The structure is designed in such a way that you can:
- Follow along with the changes in each pull request.
- Understand how to build the implementation incrementally.
- Learn not just the final outcome, but also the **process** behind it.

## How to Use

1. **Browse the pull requests**: Each one contains a detailed description of the feature or implementation it covers. [Here](https://github.com/aflopezbec/flutter_example/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)
2. **Review the changes**: You can explore the code changes step by step to see how the implementation evolves.
3. **Clone the repository**: If you want to try out the examples locally.

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests with new examples or improvements to the existing ones.
